 * Copy ctrlc1.c from blp 4th edition pg 483 (pg 466 in 3rd edition).
 * Run it. Then copy ctrlc2.c from blp 4th edition pg 488 (pg 470 in 3rd edition).
 * Note that it doesnt behave like ctrlc1.c.
 * Try SIGQUIT (^\) to quit from ctrlc2.c, see how it behaves. As an 
 * alternative way to quit, put it in the background, then issue a kill. Write
 * down a brief description of exactly how you did this. Then, modify 
 * ctrlc2.c so it behaves exactly the same as ctrl1.c (read sigaction flags
 * in blp chapter 11). Print modified ctrlc2.c to hand in. Take a look at what
 * is printed by kill -l. It's an easy way to get a list of all the 
 * signal numbers and names.

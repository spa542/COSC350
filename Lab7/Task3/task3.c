 * Write C program in which a child process writes a message "Hi, Mom" to a file
 * named foo. The parent process reads the message and prints it to stdout =>
 * "My son said Hi Mom". The part of the message "Hi Mom" should be gotten
 * from the file foo. Assume that all system calls success. (No need to error
 * check). Use only low-level file operations (fork, wait, open, close, read,
 * write, lseek). You must make sure that the child process terminates first.
